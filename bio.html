    Doja Cat is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Her career began almost accidentally with the release of “Mooo!” which became a viral meme song and launched her into popularity. Her career continued to grow, heavily aided by her active social media presence on apps like TikTok and Instagram. She is also known for her genre-bending and often out-of-the-box music style and artistic abilities. Doja Cat has been noted for her musical versatility, including genre fluidity for "crossover-ready pop songs" and her ability to sing, rap and produce. When asked about her legacy, she revealed that in future she would like to be remembered for her versatility in not only music but also visual art and dance. Her second full-length studio album, *Hot Pink*, is built with her own beats as well as a series of videos written and conceived by herself.

    Doja Cat has said, "There are people who rap in a certain way, because they want to do something so elaborate and so smart that makes you go, 'Oh my God, I would've never thought of that.' But I'd rather be the other end of that, which is being ignorant and stupid and saying whatever I want." She has also stated, "I try not to be political... I'm more like, 'I don't give a fuck, I never think about what I write. I just write whatever the first thing that comes to my mind is."
